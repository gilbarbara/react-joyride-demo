        <p>
          We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of React v16.0! Among the
          changes are some long-standing feature requests, including fragments,
          error boundaries, portals, support for custom DOM attributes, improved
          server-side rendering, and reduced file size.
        </p>

        <h3>New render return types: fragments and strings</h3>
        <p>
          You can now return an array of elements from a component‚Äôs render
          method. Like with other arrays, you‚Äôll need to add a key to each
          element to avoid the key warning:
        </p>

        <Code>{`render() {
  // No need to wrap list items in an extra element!
  return [
    // Don't forget the keys :)
    <li key="A">First item</li>,
    <li key="B">Second item</li>,
    <li key="C">Third item</li>,
  ];
}
`}</Code>

        <p>
          Starting with React 16.2.0, we are adding support for a special
          fragment syntax to JSX that doesn‚Äôt require keys.
        </p>

        <p>We‚Äôve added support for returning strings, too:</p>

        <Code>{`render() {
  return 'Look ma, no spans!';
}
`}</Code>

        <h3>Better error handling</h3>
        <p>
          Previously, runtime errors during rendering could put React in a
          broken state, producing cryptic error messages and requiring a page
          refresh to recover. To address this problem, React 16 uses a more
          resilient error-handling strategy. By default, if an error is thrown
          inside a component‚Äôs render or lifecycle methods, the whole component
          tree is unmounted from the root. This prevents the display of
          corrupted data. However, it‚Äôs probably not the ideal user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of unmounting the whole app every time there‚Äôs an error, you
          can use error boundaries. Error boundaries are special components that
          capture errors inside their subtree and display a fallback UI in its
          place. Think of error boundaries like try-catch statements, but for
          React components.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more details, check out our previous post on error handling in
          React 16.
        </p>

        <h3>Portals</h3>
        <p>
          Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node
          that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
        </p>

        <Code>{`render() {
// React does *not* create a new div. It renders the children into \`domNode\`.
// \`domNode\` is any valid DOM node, regardless of its location in the DOM.
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    this.props.children,
    domNode,
  );
}`}</Code>

        <h3>Better server-side rendering</h3>
        <p>
          React 16 includes a completely rewritten server renderer. It‚Äôs really
          fast. It supports streaming, so you can start sending bytes to the
          client faster. And thanks to a new packaging strategy that compiles
          away process.env checks (Believe it or not, reading process.env in
          Node is really slow!), you no longer need to bundle React to get good
          server-rendering performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Core team member Sasha Aickin wrote a great article describing React
          16‚Äôs SSR improvements. According to Sasha‚Äôs synthetic benchmarks,
          server rendering in React 16 is roughly three times faster than React
          15. ‚ÄúWhen comparing against React 15 with process.env compiled out,
          there‚Äôs about a 2.4x improvement in Node 4, about a 3x performance
          improvement in Node 6, and a full 3.8x improvement in the new Node 8.4
          release. And if you compare against React 15 without compilation,
          React 16 has a full order of magnitude gain in SSR in the latest
          version of Node!‚Äù (As Sasha points out, please be aware that these
          numbers are based on synthetic benchmarks and may not reflect
          real-world performance.)
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, React 16 is better at hydrating server-rendered HTML once
          it reaches the client. It no longer requires the initial render to
          exactly match the result from the server. Instead, it will attempt to
          reuse as much of the existing DOM as possible. No more checksums! In
          general, we don‚Äôt recommend that you render different content on the
          client versus the server, but it can be useful in some cases (e.g.
          timestamps). However, it‚Äôs dangerous to have missing nodes on the
          server render as this might cause sibling nodes to be created with
          incorrect attributes.
        </p>

        <p>See the documentation for ReactDOMServer for more details.</p>

        <h3>Support for custom DOM attributes</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of ignoring unrecognized HTML and SVG attributes, React will
          now pass them through to the DOM. This has the added benefit of
          allowing us to get rid of most of React‚Äôs attribute whitelist,
          resulting in reduced file sizes.
        </p>

        <h3>Reduced file size</h3>
        <p>
          Despite all these additions, React 16 is actually smaller compared to
          15.6.1!
        </p>

        <p>
          react is 5.3 kb (2.2 kb gzipped), down from 20.7 kb (6.9 kb gzipped).
          react-dom is 103.7 kb (32.6 kb gzipped), down from 141 kb (42.9 kb
          gzipped). react + react-dom is 109 kb (34.8 kb gzipped), down from
          161.7 kb (49.8 kb gzipped). That amounts to a combined 32% size
          decrease compared to the previous version (30% post-gzip).
        </p>

        <p>
          The size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging.
          React now uses Rollup to create flat bundles for each of its different
          target formats, resulting in both size and runtime performance wins.
          The flat bundle format also means that React‚Äôs impact on bundle size
          is roughly consistent regardless of how you ship your app, whether
          it‚Äôs with Webpack, Browserify, the pre-built UMD bundles, or any other
          system.
        </p>

        <h3>MIT licensed</h3>
        <p>
          In case you missed it, React 16 is available under the MIT license.
          We‚Äôve also published React 15.6.2 under MIT, for those who are unable
          to upgrade immediately.
        </p>

        <h3>New core architecture</h3>
        <p>
          React 16 is the first version of React built on top of a new core
          architecture, codenamed ‚ÄúFiber.‚Äù You can read all about this project
          over on Facebook‚Äôs engineering blog. (Spoiler: we rewrote React!)
        </p>

        <p>
          Fiber is responsible for most of the new features in React 16, like
          error boundaries and fragments. Over the next few releases, you can
          expect more new features as we begin to unlock the full potential of
          React.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps the most exciting area we‚Äôre working on is async rendering‚Äîa
          strategy for cooperatively scheduling rendering work by periodically
          yielding execution to the browser. The upshot is that, with async
          rendering, apps are more responsive because React avoids blocking the
          main thread.
        </p>

        <p>
          This demo provides an early peek at the types of problems async
          rendering can solve:
        </p>

  render() {
    const { run, steps } = this.state;

    return (

        <ReactJoyride
          run={run}
