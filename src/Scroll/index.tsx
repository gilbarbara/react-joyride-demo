        <H2 mt={0}>New Features in React 18</H2>
        <Paragraph>
          React 18 has arrived with a host of new features and improvements, offering developers
          even more power and flexibility in building user interfaces. This latest version brings
          some significant updates that aim to enhance performance, ease development workflows, and
          provide better developer experience overall. Let's delve into the exciting new features in
          React 18:
        </Paragraph>

        <H3 mt="md">1. React Server Components</H3>
        <Paragraph>
          React Server Components is a groundbreaking addition to React 18, introducing a new
          programming model that allows developers to build components that run on the server. With
          server components, you can fetch and compute data on the server, providing faster
          rendering and a more efficient use of resources. This feature enables rendering dynamic
          components on the server and transferring only the essential state updates to the client,
          resulting in improved performance and reduced time to interactive experiences.
        </Paragraph>

        <H3 mt="md">2. Automatic JSX Transform</H3>
        <Paragraph>
          React 18 simplifies the development process by introducing automatic JSX transform. In
          previous versions, developers needed to set up tooling to transform JSX syntax into
          JavaScript code that React could understand. With React 18, this transformation is
          automatically handled by React itself, eliminating the need for additional build
          configurations and reducing the setup complexity.
        </Paragraph>

        <H3 mt="md">3. Suspense SSR</H3>
        <Paragraph>
          React 18 enhances Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities with the introduction of
          Suspense SSR. SSR is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending
          the pre-rendered HTML to the client for faster initial page loads and improved SEO.
          Suspense SSR allows developers to use the Suspense component to declaratively handle data
          fetching and code-splitting during the server rendering process, enabling better control
          and optimization of server-rendered content.
        </Paragraph>

        <H3 mt="md">4. React Refresh</H3>
        <Paragraph>
          Building on the success of Fast Refresh, React 18 introduces React Refresh, a new
          hot-reloading feature that provides a more reliable and stable development experience.
          React Refresh allows you to make changes to your code while preserving the component
          state, avoiding unnecessary full reloads of the application, and providing faster
          turnaround times during development.
        </Paragraph>

        <H3 mt="md">5. Improved DevTools</H3>
        <Paragraph>
          React 18 comes with enhanced Developer Tools that provide a more intuitive and insightful
          debugging experience. The updated DevTools offer improved support for profiling,
          identifying performance bottlenecks, and understanding component re-renders. This helps
          developers optimize their applications and deliver better performance to end-users.
        </Paragraph>

        <H3 mt="md">In Conclusion</H3>
        <Paragraph>
          React 18 introduces several exciting features that aim to improve performance, streamline
          development workflows, and enhance the overall developer experience. With server
          components, automatic JSX transform, Suspense SSR, React Refresh, and improved DevTools,
          React developers can benefit from increased flexibility, better performance, and more
          efficient development processes. As you dive into React 18, make sure to explore these new
          features and leverage their potential to build impressive, high-performing user
          interfaces. Happy coding!
